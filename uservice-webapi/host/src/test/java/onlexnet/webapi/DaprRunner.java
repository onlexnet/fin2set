 * Context:
 * on real environment, DAPR is started and configured using terraform scripots and all environment variables
 * (especially related to service principal id/secret) are already on place.
 * In tests we have missing two important variables which are enough to read the reast of secrets from key vault.
 * They are: FIN2SET_CLIENT_ID and FIN2SET_CLIENT_SECRET. They are used to instaniate principal able to read the rest
 * of secrets.
